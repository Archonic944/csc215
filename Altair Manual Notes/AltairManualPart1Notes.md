# Part 1: Introduction

## Logic
* Boolean logic invented by George Boole
* Circuits are either in ON or OFF states, mirroring Boole's logic conditions of true or false
* All logic statements have electronic equivalents


## Electronic Logic
Logic statements:
* And
* Or
* Not
* Nand
* Nor

Three or more logic circuits = logic system.

The XOR circuit is often called a binary adder.

Some XOR systems will include a carry bit to assist with adding.

A flip-flop changes state only when an incoming pulse arrives.

Monostable circuits: Occupy 1 of 2 states unless an incoming pulse is received, after which they occupy an opposite state for a brief preiod of time then return to their normal state.

Astable: Switching back and forth between two states

Logic gates do not only have control inputs. They also have access to + power (1 state) and - power (0 state). The controls modify the state of a transistor, which either lets in a full strength 0 or a full strength 1 from the respective power source.

## Number Systems

* We use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.
* Computers are most compatible with systems on a power of 2 (2, 8, 16)

## The Binary System

* Counting in any number system: 

> Record successive digits for each count in a column. When the total number of available digits has been used, begin a new column to the left of the first and resume counting.

* Converting a binary number to decimal: multiple the value of each column (0 or 1) by 2 raised to the index of that column
